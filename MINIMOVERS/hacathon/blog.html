                    <br>
                    4. Practice Self-Care: Take time for yourself to recharge, as a healthy and happy parent is better equipped to care for their child.

                    1. Physical Milestones: Babies go through various physical milestones, such as rolling over, sitting up, crawling, and walking. These milestones typically occur within specific age ranges, and it's important for parents to encourage physical activity to support their child's growth.
                    
                    <br>
                    2. Cognitive Development: Cognitive skills develop rapidly in the first year, including problem-solving, memory, and language acquisition. Parents can stimulate cognitive development by engaging in activities like reading, playing with toys that encourage exploration, and providing sensory experiences.
                    
                    <br>
                    3. Social and Emotional Growth: Babies begin to form attachments and express emotions from a young age. Social interactions, such as smiling, cooing, and playing with caregivers, help foster emotional security and social skills.
                    
                    <br>
                    4. Language Development: Language skills start developing early, with babies recognizing sounds and responding to their names by a few months old. Parents can support language development by talking, singing, and reading to their baby regularly.
                    <br>
                    
                    5. Sensory Development: Babies learn about their world through their senses. Engaging their sense of sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell through varied experiences and safe toys helps enhance their sensory development and promotes overall growth.
